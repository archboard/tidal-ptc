# Tidal PTC

Tidal PTC (parent-teacher conferences) is [Archboard's](https://archboard.io) first open source project. It is a web application that allows parents and guardians to schedule parent-teacher conferences with their children's teachers. It has direct integration with PowerSchool, which makes it easy for IT admins to set up and get running.

## Progress

This is a version 2.0 of the original Tidal PTC, and a complete rewrite. This section tracks the major milestones of the project. Once the project has basic functionality, more details and documentation will be added. If you'd like additional features to be included, open an issue with the details of what you'd like to see. For any additional inquiries, please email [Grant Holle](mailto:grant@archboard.io).
